## Abstract

## Introduction

Changes to the global carbon cycle by anthropogenic climate change driven by fossil fuel-derived $CO_{2}$ emissions has spurred efforts to account for carbon stored across different ecosystems to constrain estimates of potential change [@griscom2017; @ellisPrinciplesNaturalClimate2024]. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an immense pool of carbon and a key foundation for ecosystem carbon cycling with the potential for long-term sequestration [@bossio2020; @scharlemann2014]. Ecosystem SOC stocks can vary substantially between different ecosystem types due to differences in climate, primary productivity, and other SOC accumulation drivers. Moreover, a diversity of ecosystems can exist across both landscape and regional scales, creating heterogeneous spatial patterns of SOC stocks. This heterogeneity has been a persistent challenge for accurately modeling the spatial distribution of SOC. In particular, current models and maps of SOC have often omitted large SOC stocks stored by inland freshwater wetlands which accumulate SOC due to their water saturated soils which limit decomposition of deceased plant material.

Inland freshwater wetland and peatland ecosystems disproportionately contribute to the SOC pool on a per-area basis, storing approximately 30% of the global SOC pool in 6-8% of the land surface area [@nahlikCarbonStorageUS2016; @uhranImprovedWetlandSoil2021; @jacksonEcologySoilCarbon2017; @poulterReviewGlobalWetland2021]. Despite this disproportionate SOC storage, inland freshwater wetlands are often difficult to adequately represent in maps and spatial models of SOC. The detrimental effect of under-representing wetlands is evident in global models of SOC distribution leading to misleading estimates of total SOC stored across different regions [@tifafiLargeDifferencesGlobal2018]. At smaller scales, wetlands can be especially elusive with small areal extents under forest canopy and a lack of identifying hydrologic features, leading to underestimates of the proportion of the total landscape SOC stored in wetland soils [@stewartRevealingHiddenCarbon2024]. Incorporating wetland soils into maps of SOC distribution is a pathway towards more comprehensive representation of soil types which can greatly assist in reducing the uncertainty in estimates of total SOC stocks [@kochyGlobalDistributionSoil2015a]. However, this incorporation is hindered by the lack of incorporating wetland formation with other SOC accumulation drivers.

Recently, it has been proposed that applying the soil formation theory, which aims to describe the short and long-term soil formation drivers at the landscape scale, is necessary in order address gaps in understanding soil carbon cycling and its spatial variability [@doetterlLandscapescaleViewSoil2025]. Within the scope of this perspective, we suggest a more comprehensive and accurate representation of landscape SOC stock needs to include inland freshwater wetlands. In order to achieve this improved representation, the factors and drivers of wetland presence and formation should be captured by potential model predictors along with other predictors representing primary soil forming factors. Soil formation and development for inland freshwater wetlands has similarities to conventional non-wetland soils but with emphasis on hillslope hydrology and differences with peatland development [@vepraskasWetlandSoilsGenesis2016]. Yet, drivers of wetland SOC stocks and accumulation are more unclear, especially with variability across different wetland types notwithstanding the differences amongst climatic zones [@davidsonUnrecognizedImportanceCarbon2022]. Much of the recent understanding of SOC drivers where climate and geochemistry have been shown to interact, is derived from research on non-wetland soils with wetlands or histosols excluded from analysis [@doetterlSoilCarbonStorage2015; @cotrufoSoilCarbonStorage2019; @vonfrommControlsRelationshipsSoil2024]. But recent research has also shown that the addition of wetland presence enhances the representation of landscape SOC stocks [@vitharanaFactorsControllingSpatial2024]. This leaves potential gaps in understanding the true spatial distribution of SOC stocks and their drivers. A particular uncertainty to address is if the incorporation of wetland soils will indicate that large amounts of wetland SOC would need to be added to the current total SOC pool or, if the current total SOC pool is more distributed into wetlands and wet areas that have yet to be identified. To address this uncertainty, more robust wetland mapping is needed that accurately represents wetlands.

Wetland mapping and identification has a long research history but has benefited from a recent paradigm shift towards data driven approaches utilizing remote sensing data and machine learning [@fluet-chouinardExtensiveGlobalWetland2023; @poggioDigitalSoilMapping2020; @laneMappingGlobalNonfloodplain2023; @hribljanMultidateMultisensorRemote2017; @dronovaRemoteSensingPhenology2022]. There are a growing number of wetland datasets ranging from regional and continental scales such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetland Inventory (NWI) [@langStatusTrendsWetlands2024] to global scales such as WAD2M [@zhangDevelopmentGlobalDataset2021] and the Global Non-Floodplain Wetland dataset [@laneMappingGlobalNonfloodplain2023]. These rich data sources have been used to produce estimate of wetland SOC stock such as the case with the NWI in @nahlikCarbonStorageUS2016 and @uhranImprovedWetlandSoil2021. However, separately estimating inland wetland SOC stocks through their location limits the potential inference made for drivers of SOC stock. A growing approach that has improved wetland mapping across landscape and global scales is modeling the continuous spatial probability gradients that correspond with wetland presence [@delanceyLargescaleProbabilisticIdentification2019; @halabisky2023; @zhangDevelopmentGlobalDataset2021]. This probabilistic wetland mapping approach, leveraging topography metrics in machine learning helps reveal soil hydrology patterns beyond what is captured through simpler metrics such as slope or topographic wetness index [@beven1979]. Moreover, probabilistic gradients of wetland presence across terrestrial landscapes correspond to xeric, mesic, and hydric soil moisture regimes [@agrenUseMultipleLIDARderived2021; @lidbergUsingMachineLearning2020]. Modeling these soil moisture regimes and soil hydrology patterns through probabilistic wetland mapping also captures the hillslope hydrology formation process which is a key driver of SOC accumulation and fits within the soil formation theory framework [@lawrenceTrajectorySoilDevelopment2021; @doetterlLandscapescaleViewSoil2025].

Estimating the wetland SOC stocks and its spatial distribution in one landscape is a continuing challenge but complicated when attempted across larger scales and different heterogeneous landscapes [@jacksonEcologySoilCarbon2017; @jungkunstGlobalSoilOrganic2022a]. For non-wetland soils, there has been substantial research on the patterns and drivers of SOC stock and concentration across plots, landscapes, and regional scales showing drivers such as climate, topography and geochemistry [@jennyFactorsSoilFormation1994; @vonfrommControlsRelationshipsSoil2024; @minasnyDigitalSoilMapping2016; @doetterlSoilCarbonStorage2015]. For wetland soils, currently mapped estimates of wetland SOC across the U.S. show SOC stocks vary predictably across climatic regions [@nahlikCarbonStorageUS2016; @uhranImprovedWetlandSoil2021]. More specifically, Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) can be significant driver of SOC stock and accumulation at regional scales compared to Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) [@mcnicolLargeClimatesensitiveSoil2019]. At landscape scales, topography factors can promote areas of water saturation and SOC accumulation [@vitharanaFactorsControllingSpatial2024; @tangenSoilOrganicCarbon2020]. Metrics that delineate soil moisture patterns and gradients can be especially large drivers of SOC stocks across landscapes by capturing wetland and peatland forming areas [@larsonSoilMoistureControls2023]. Then, soil edaphic and geochemical factors can influence SOC concentration within the local scale of these wet environments [@nieStorageControllingFactors2023]. Indeed, capturing the soil forming factors at the landscape-scale such as gradients of soil water saturation and understanding the influence of edaphic factors at the local scale can be useful for more comprehensive representation of the overall SOC stock spatial distribution [@doetterlLandscapescaleViewSoil2025].

In this research, we aim to use probabilistic wetland mapping as a spatial representation of soil moisture regime to advance the representation of wetlands and wetland SOC stock in landscapes across different climatic regions. Previous SOC mapping research has instead relied on wetland map inventories or soil type maps to delineate of wetland areas and help predict high SOC stocks [@sotheLargeScaleMapping2022]. Further, although efforts such as the National Wetland Condition Assessment [@nahlikCarbonStorageUS2016; @uhranImprovedWetlandSoil2021] have provided access to geolocated SOC stock data for wetlands, they are not as abundant as data for upland SOC stocks. Small wetlands, especially in forests, can also be missed by SOC sampling and mapping efforts leading to under representation of these wetland types [@davidsonUnrecognizedImportanceCarbon2022; @sotheLargeSoilCarbon2022]. Therefore, this research addresses three questions: 1) how do models of SOC stock spatial distribution and concentration perform when wetland and upland observations are combined?; and 2) what are the drivers of overall SOC stock and concentration?; finally, 3) how do landscapes with wetland SOC stock representation to currently available maps of landscape SOC? We then address three hypotheses: 1) Models will be able to predict SOC stocks and concentration across both wetlands and uplands when a continuous wetland probability predictor is included with additional climate, terrain, and biological predictors; and 2) We expect either PET:MAP or MAP and the probabilistic wetland predictor to be more significant predictors of overall SOC stocks with high SOC concentrations in wetlands; and 3) We expect similar total SOC stock between our modeling with wetlands and other models without, however more of the SOC in our modeled landscape will be contained in wetland area. <!--# We collected 481 soil samples by horizon in 96 pedons across a landscape gradient between wetlands and uplands with three study watersheds spanning an East-West precipitation climatic gradient. We implemented statistical and machine learning models using a depth-resolved dataset and an aggregated pedon dataset across wetlands and uplands to assess the model performance for predicting SOC stocks.  This research approach addresses the following questions:  -->

## Methods

### Study Areas

![Map of study watersheds in the Pacific Northwest of North America. The Heen Latinee Experimental Forest (HLEF) is located in Southeast Alaska. The Hoh River Watershed (HRW), Mashel River Watershed (MRW), and Colville Valley Watershed (CVW) are located in Washington State. Basemap imagery provided by OpenStreetMap. Map lines delineate study areas and do not necessarily depict accepted national boundaries](Figures/PNW_Study_Areas.png){#fig-studymap fig-align="center" width="6.5in"}

We conducted field surveys, sample collection, and geospatial modeling across four study watersheds in the Pacific Northwest that stratify a climatic gradient [@fig-studymap]. The Heen Latinee Experiemental Forest (HLEF) is located in Southeast Alaska near Juneau, AK with a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of approximately 2284 mm and a mean annual temperature (MAT) of 4.3 ^o^C. The Hoh River Watershed (HRW) is located on the west coast of the Olympic Peninsula where MAP is approximately 3061 mm and MAT is 10.0 ^o^C. The Mashel River Watershed (MRW) is located on the western side of the Cascade Mountain Range near Tahoma (Mt. Rainier) and has a MAT of 8.4 ^o^C and a MAP of approximately 1716 mm. The Colville Watershed (CVW) is located on the northeastern portion of the state and has a MAT of 6.5 ^o^C and a MAP of 652 mm. The landscapes of the four study areas contain a range of landforms including mountains, hillslopes, alluvial floodplains, and glacial deposits. Geologic ages range from prominent recent Quaternary material from retreating glaciers in the HLEF and HRW, Oligocene-Eocene volcanic and sedimentary deposits in the MRW to Pre-Teriary metamorphic rocks in the CRW. Vegetation is predominantly forested with the HLEF containing a mix of Western Hemlock (*Tsuga heterophylla*), and Sitka Spruce (*Picea sitchensis*) with small amounts of Yellow Cedar (*Cupressus nootkatensis*). The HRW forests contain Sitka Spruce (*Picea sitchensis*), Western Hemlock (*Tsuga heterophylla*), Western Red Cedar (*Thuja plicata*), and Bigleaf Maple (Acer macrophyllum). The MRW forests contain predominantly Douglas fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*), Western Hemlock (*Tsuga heterophylla*), and Red Alder (*Alnus rubra*). The CVW forests contain a mix of Ponderosa Pine (*Pinus ponderosa*), Douglas fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*), Lodgepole pine (*Pinus contorta*), Western Larch (*Larix occidentalis*), Western Hemlock (*Tsuga heterophylla*), and Western Red Cedar (*Thuja plicata*).

### Wetland Identification with the Wetland Intrinsic Potential (WIP) Tool

We implemented the Wetland Intrinsic Potential (WIP) tool for each study watershed to identify wetlands and gradients of uplands-to-wetlands. The WIP tool is thoroughly described in @halabisky2023 and was implemented for wetland identification in the HRW. We utilized both the data and framework of the HRW WIP implementation to derive similar WIP models for the HLEF, MRW, and CRW study areas. Data for the WIP tool included Lidar digitial terrain models (DTMs), digital surface models (DSMs), and imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). Lidar DTMs and DSMs were downloaded from the WA Department of Natural Resources Lidar Portal and spanned a range of dates from 2008-2016 in the CVW and 2007-2011 in the MRW in order to create a continuous surface area of the study areas. We also used the earliest available NAIP imagery from 2017. No NAIP data were available for the HLEF and we therefore utilized Sentinel 2 for vegetation indices. A Lidar DTM and DSM were also downloaded from the Alaska State Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys Elevation portal and were collected in 2012.

The WIP tool relies on multi-scale terrain metrics derived from DTMs as predictors of wetland presence on the landscape which has been shown to improve wetland classification [@maxwell2016; @maxwell2019]. We calculated these terrain indices using the Surface Metrics Toolbox developed by @halabisky2023 and implemented in ArcGIS Pro 3.1. The multi-scale terrain indices included gradient (slope), planform curvature, profile curvature, and deviation from the mean elevation calculated at 50 m, 300 m, and 1000 m length scales. Additional terrain metrics included Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) @beven1979, Topographic Depth to Water, and Elevation. We also included the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Canopy Height in addition to terrain metrics for the WIP model. NDVI and NDWI were derived from aerial imagery collected by NAIP. We then took these 18 geospatial metrics and re-sampled them to a 4 m resolution to match the former WIP model in the HRW. The default resolution for the HLEF was 5m and all HLEF data were resampled to this resolution. However, we did not include soil hydraulic conductivity and depth to any restricted layers from the United States Department of Agriculture SSURGO soil database and used in the HRW WIP because of their poor performance as predictors in the HRW WIP.

We derived training data for wetlands and uplands (non-wetlands) using the geospatial dataset from the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) and the Wetland Mapper Tool ( <!--# Citation Needed -->). We extracted 3000 total training points from NWI wetlands in the HLEF, MRW, and CVW study areas (6000 total points) with approximately 2/3 of the training points classified as "upland" and 1/3 classified as "wetland". The training points were then used to extract data from the geospatial metrics in each study area. A random forest model was then constructed using a 70:30 training and testing dataset partition and then used to generate a preliminary WIP model. From this preliminary model, we utilized a similar approach to @halabisky2023 and generated another training dataset and a validation dataset by conducting a stratified sampling of 600 points and 300 points, respectively across the gradient of the preliminary model. The points from this stratification were then verified as either wetland or upland by two analysts who conducted site visits and referenced points using aerial imagery, pre-existing NWI data, and lidar-derived hillshades. The new training and validation points were then used in another separate random forest model which generated the final mapped prediction of the WIP model. Accuracy metrics for the MRW and CVW were comparable to the HRW with Kappa = 0.80 for the MRW and Kappa = 0.81 for the CVW. The HLEF is a smaller watershed than the other three study watersheds and used 500 training points and 100 validation points for the WIP model. The HLEF model had a Kappa = 0.73 and an overall accuracy of 88%. More metrics are provided in Supporting Material Table X <!--# Supporting table needed -->.

Soil samples were collected over the course of two field summer field seasons in 2020-2022. Sample locations were pre-selected using a stratified random selection of points across the WIP probability for each study watershed in order to evaluate the full spread of the wetland-upland gradient. The WIP probability from 0-100% was stratified into 30 equal size bins and sample points were generated for those bins at random locations within each study watershed. Sample locations were then visited in the field as close to the sample point coordinates as possible and then updated with new GPS/GNSS location data. Overall we collected samples from 114 pedon locations with 30 pedons each in the MRW and CVW, 36 pedons in the HRW, and 18 pedons in the HLEF. The HLEF also contained 3 legacy soil pedons sampled in 2019. Soil pedons were dug to at least 1m depth unless there was a restrictive layer. Soil pedons were characterized according to NRCS field sampling guides and soil samples for bulk density and bulk chemistry were extracted by horizon and at the horizon center. Field site characterization included assessing for wetland presence and classifying according to Cowardin and Hydrogeomorphic classifications and ultimately 33 sites were classified as wetlands with some sites containing various wetland features making these quick field assessments difficult. According to the WIP probability 46 sites were classified as wetlands and 68 were classified as uplands with our field site classification composing 84% of the WIP wetlands. We emphasize that field assessments are not meant to be considered true wetland delineations which require more time to evaluate specific wetland indicators and criteria. Laboratory analysis started with drying samples to a constant weight at 70^o^C and sieving to 2mm to remove coarse fragments. The mass of the \< 2mm fraction was then used to calculate bulk density and analyze carbon content, particle size distribution, and pH. Carbon content was measured using a Shimadzu Elemental Analyzer. Particle size distribution was measured using the hydrometer method. pH was measured using 1:1 soil to water ratio.

### Geospatial data

Geospatial datasets were gathered to determine predictors for SOC stocks across the three study areas. We chose geospatial factors related to vegetation, climate, lithology and geology, and topography. For vegetation spectral indices, we used Google Earth Engine @gorelickGoogleEarthEngine2017 to obtain satellite imagery for index calculation from the 5 year median of Sentinel-2 reflectance. In particular for each study area we calculated the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) [@hueteOverviewRadiometricBiophysical2002]\] and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Other metrics such as the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were also investigated but deemed too comparable to either NDVI or EVI to be included in the model. We also used a lidar derived canopy height model from the Washington Department of Natural Resources (WA DNR) which was measured as the elevation difference between the lidar DTM and the lidar DSM.

For climate predictors, we downloaded 800m^2^ gridded 30 year climate normals for mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) from the Northwest Alliance for Computation Science and Engineering PRISM Climate Group @prismclimategroup30YearNormals for the three Washington study watersheds. We used \~1km gridded historical climate data from WorldClim 2.1 to extract MAP and MAT for the HLEF. In addition, we also downloaded Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) from the Version 3 of the Global Aridity Index and Potential Evapotranspiration Database for all four study areas [@zomerVersion3Global2022]. PET was divided by MAP to create an Aridity Index estimate of water availability. To capture finer scale effects of solar radiation and heat, we calculated a heat load index (HLI) from the lidar DTM [@mccuneEquationsPotentialAnnual2002].

Geolithology maps were downloaded from the Washington Department of Natural Resources at a 1:100,000 scale and from the USGS [@wilsonGeologicMapAlaska2015]. We chose to consolidate the wide range of mapped lithological categories into six broad categories which would represent potential soil parent material and time since soil inception: Glacial Till and Drift, Glacial Outwash, Igneous, Metamorphic, Sedimentary, and Unconsolidated. Both Alaska and Washington State are glacially influenced and we therefore modified glacial lithological categories into two categories corresponding to stratified (Glacial Outwash) and unstratified (Glacial Till and Drift). Glacial drift is a broad term referring to all types of glacial deposits and is difficult to assess stratification without more detailed examination of geomorphologic processes beyond the use of the available maps. Therefore we chose to group Glacial Drift with Glacial Till as a broad "unstratified" category. More details regarding the reclassification of lithological categories are provided in Supporting Table 1 <!--# Supporting Table -->.

### Modeling approach

#### Data structure

Our approach consisted of separating our data into two datasets: one for SOC stocks by equal depth intervals and another for SOC concentration (%) using the original depth measurements. For the SOC stock dataset we utilized a Digital Soil Mapping approach to transform our SOC stock data into equal intervals of 25cm using a mass preserving spline depth function [@chenDigitalMappingGlobalSoilMap2022; @obrienMpspline2MasspreservingSpline2022]. This approach is common in DSM and has been referred to as 3-Dimensional because it facilitates the prediction of soil properties at any location within the study area at the designated depth intervals [@helfensteinThreedimensionalSpaceTime2024; @maloneMappingContinuousDepth2009; @bishopModellingSoilAttribute1999]. The decision to use 25cm intervals instead of the standardized intervals was to control the variability of SOC stock with depth interval thickness. We also chose this interval length to maintain a similar number of observations without exceeding the original dataset (Original: 573, Spline 499). We used the mass preserving spline function to calculate values of SOC %, Bulk Density, and Rock % down profile using a lambda = 0.7. These numbers were then used to calculate SOC stocks for each 25cm depth interval by [@eq-SOC-stock-spline]:

$$Spline\,SOC_{g\,cm^{-2}} = SOC_{\%} * BD_{g\,cm^{-3}}*25cm*(1-Rock_{\%})$$ {#eq-SOC-stock-spline}

For the SOC % dataset we removed observations that were organic soils (\< 10% SOC) and did not contain measurements of Sand, Silt, Clay, or pH. We did not use this dataset for digital soil mapping and therefore kept the original depth intervals. This dataset contained 426 observations compared to the 499 in the spline dataset and 573 in the original dataset. Both datasets for SOC stock and SOC % were split into training and testing datasets using a 85:15 ratio. The same training and testing datasets would be used for all models to compare performance and accuracy.

#### Model Building and Selection

##### Linear Mixed Modeling

We chose to use two model types in our research to model SOC stock and SOC %: a linear mixed effects model (LMM) and a quantile random forest (RFM), creating four models in total. We chose to use a linear mixed effect modelling approach to test specific hypotheses about important predictors and examine predictor coefficients. In the LMMs, the sample location was chosen as a random effect and sample depth was specified as a random slope within the sample location. We chose to build several models that represented our a priori hypotheses with varying interactions between the predictors as well as eliminating predictors that were not significant down to a null model with no predictors. The final model was chosen using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and parsimony then evaluated for violations of homogeneity of variance and linearity. Although some observations deviated slightly from the homoscedasticity assumption (Supporting Figure 3)<!--# Supporting Figure -->, we deemed the model assumptions sufficiently met and therefore used to evaluate drivers and predict SOC stock and SOC %.

All data used to build models of SOC stock and SOC % were centered and scaled if they were continuous predictors. Correlated variables were removed if they had an r \> 0.6. However, at this scale MAP and PET:MAP are highly correlated and thus we used separate models to assess the strength between the two predictors in our mixed model selection. The initial model selection process using maximum likelihood showed that models using PET:MAP instead of MAP were better fits to the data according to AIC.

For SOC stock, LMM selection using AIC comparisons removed models containing interactions among fixed effects, resulting in SOC stock modeled as a function of PET:MAP, WIP, Canopy Height (CHM), Heat Load Index (HLI), Geolithology, and Depth as fixed effects @eq-model1 :

$$
SOC\,stock\,_{ij} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{_{ij}}MAT + \beta_{_{ij}}PET:MAP + \beta_{_{ij}}WIP + \beta_{_{ij}}CHM +  \beta_{_{ij}}Geolithology + \beta_{_{ij}}Depth + b_{0_{j}} + b_{{ij}}Depth + \epsilon_{ij}
$$ {#eq-model1}

For SOC %, the LMM selection process was similar to SOC stock where fixed effects in separate models were removed depending on the AIC values. The best LMM at this stage contained depth, pH, Clay, and PET:MAP with interactions between the variables the latter three predictors. After this LMM was found, we also used the `dredge` function from the `MuMIn` R package to further identify if incorporated interactions between Clay % or Silt+Clay% and MAT outperformed the current LMM structure determined from earlier [@bartonMuMInMultimodelInference2023]. The final LMM was chosen with the lowest AIC and/or fewest LMM parameters for parsimony with PET:MAP, pH, Clay% and Depth as fixed effects @eq-model2 :

$$
SOC\,\%\,_{ij} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{_{ij}}PET:MAP + \beta_{_{ij}}Clay\% + \beta_{_{ij}}pH +  \beta_{_{ij}}pH:(PET:MAP) + \beta_{_{ij}}Depth + b_{0_{j}} + b_{{ij}}Depth + \epsilon_{ij}
$$ {#eq-model2}

All random effects in the LMM followed:

$$
b_{0j} \sim N(0, \sigma^{2}_{b_{0}}) 
$$ {#eq-model3}

$$
b_{_{ij}}Depth\sim N(0, \sigma^{2}_{b_{Depth}}) 
$$ {#eq-model4}

$$
\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^{2}) 
$$ {#eq-model5}

Where $b_{0j}$ is the random intercept for the $j$-th group of each sample location and $b_{_{ij}}Depth$ is the random slope of depth within the sample location. Summaries of the distributions of random effects are located in the Supporting Figure 2<!--# SUPPORTING FIGURE -->. The final model was evaluated on the test dataset by measuring the R^2^ and root mean square error (RMSE). Predictor variable importance was estimated using the 95% confidence intervals on the scaled coefficient estimates with important predictors having a confidence interval that did not cross 0.

We also examined SOC stock data and model residuals for spatial autocorrelation by examining semivariograms and the spatial autocorrelation within each study watershed expecting there to be minimal autocorrelation. Indeed, only there was minimal spatial autocorrelation shown by the semivariograms within and across all study watersheds (Supporting Figure 1)<!--# Supporting Figure -->. We concluded that our proposed model structure did not need to include a spatial autocorrelation random effect.

##### Random Forest Modeling

The Quantile Random Forest (RFM) was used to accommodate for potential non-linear relationships in our data as well as incorporate a more flexible approach to predictor selection. We used the `mlr3` package in `R` to implement the RFM from the `ranger` package [@wrightRangerFastImplementation2017; @mlr3]. We used recursive feature elimination to narrow the number of predictors used in the model. Then, we tuned `num.trees`, `mtry`, and `max.depth` using repeated 10-fold cross validation on the training dataset. Out of bag (OOB) R^2^ and RMSE were calculated from the model implemented on the training dataset. We R^2^ and RMSE for the RFM on the test dataset similar to the LMM. Predictor variable importance was determined using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values using a 200 observation subset of the training dataset as the rows to be explained and the full training dataset as the background [@lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017]. SHAP values were visualized using the `kernelshap` package [@mayerKernelshapKernelSHAP2024] We also investigated interactions between predictors in the RFM using the interpretable machine learning `iml` package @molnar2018iml and the `Interaction` function [@molnar2018iml].

#### SOC stock prediction and uncertainty

We chose to generate mapped predictions of SOC stock across all four study watersheds using the model with the best fit to the test dataset (R^2^ and RMSE). The RFM was selected with this criteria and was used to generate SOC predictions for each depth interval (25cm) and then combined to calculate a 1m SOC stock. The RFM was built as a quantile random forest allowing the prediction of the 97.5% and 2.5% quantiles of SOC stock. We used these quantiles as the 95% prediction interval and to show uncertainty ranges for our prediction.

We also used additional geospatial masks to remove surface water areas and urban zones. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was used to remove surface water with a threshold of 0.3 [@xuModificationNormalisedDifference2006]. The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) was used to mask urban areas such as roads [@dewitzNationalLandCover2021]. Geospatial masks using the WIP threshold of 0.50 or 50% were used to estimate wetland and upland 1m SOC stocks and were compared with 1m SOC stock data from the National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA) which was upscaled using the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) in @uhranImprovedWetlandSoil2021. We show these estimates using the the term NWCA~NLCD~.

We also extracted estimates of SOC stock from open data sources that have been used to model the spatial distribution of SOC at regional to global scales. For all study areas, we used an estimated mean 1m SOC stock from an ensemble combination of global and regional models compiled and calculated by @jonesEnsembleModelInput2024 for Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawai'i. Additionally, a published map of 1m SOC stocks was created specifically for the Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest by @mcnicolLargeClimatesensitiveSoil2019 which encompasses the HLEF.

## Results

### Variation across climatic gradient

SOC stocks were variable across the three study watershed across the WA climatic gradient but the lowest SOC stocks within depth intervals were observed in the CVW [@tbl-mean_stdev_stocks_table]. The largest SOC stocks were mostly in the HLEF. Deep wetland pedons (\> 1 m) were sampled in the HLEF leading to the high SOC stocks measured in the 125-150cm depth interval. When SOC stocks were aggregated to a 1m depth, the mean 1m SOC stocks were highest in the HLEF followed by the HRW, MRW, and CVW with high variability in each study watershed. Mean 1m SOC stocks in wetlands were also higher in the HRW compared to the MRW and CVW. However, there were large (\> 400 MgC ha^-1^) for three pedons in the MRW.

Mineral SOC % was more evenly distributed across wetlands and uplands after using a threshold of 10% carbon concentration to split organic soils from the original dataset [@tbl-mean-SOC-perc-table]. This threshold cutoff removed proportionally more horizons from the HLEF dataset, indicating many organic horizons. The largest number of organic horizons removed was from the HRW. Mineral SOC % appeared highest in the HRW which had the largest MAP. The MRW, had larger mineral SOC % compared to the HLEF. Interestingly, upland soils in the HRW had the highest mineral SOC % followed by wetlands and uplands in the MRW. The lowest SOC % was found in both uplands and wetlands in the CVW.

### Performance of models for SOC stock

The linear mixed model (LMM) for predicting SOC stocks at different depths across the wetland-upland gradient accounted for 48% of the variability in the training dataset with marginal R^2^ of 0.48 representing the fixed effects and a conditional R^2^ of 0.91 including the random effects of sample location with depth [@tbl-model-stats]. However, in the test dataset, the LMM accounted for a much lower proportion of the variation with an R^2^ = 0.28 and had higher variability with an RMSE = 0.41g cm^-2^[@fig-predact-graph]. Separating the uplands and wetlands in the test dataset revealed the LMM had better prediction for the upland SOC stocks (R^2^ = 0.39, RMSE = 0.30g cm^-2^) compared to the wetlands (R^2^ = 0.21, RMSE = 0.51g cm^-2^). In contrast to the LMM, the quantile random forest model (RFM) had a lower R^2^ = 0.43 and comparable RMSE = 0.41g cm^-2^ when using the out of bag (OOB) data from the training dataset. The RFM outperformed the LMM on the test dataset with an R^2^ = 0.50 and RMSE = 0.35g cm^-2^. The RFM also predicted the the uplands test data (R^2^ = 0.54, RMSE = 0.26g cm^-2^) better compared to the wetland test data (R^2^ = 0.45, RMSE = 0.45g cm^-2^), with both predictions better fits than the LMM. Both models can be characterized as underestimating high SOC stocks. @fig-predact-graph A. & B. show the higher SOC stocks were largely in more wet and wetland soils which is consistent with the model performance in the wetland portion of the test dataset.

### Performance of models for SOC Concentration (SOC %)

The LMM for predicting SOC concentration (SOC %) showed a more robust fit to the training data than the LMM for SOC stocks with a marginal R^2^ = 0.59 and conditional R^2^ = 0.83 [@tbl-model-stats]. The LMM fit to the test dataset showed better performance than the LMM for SOC stocks with a R^2^ = 0.56 and RMSE = 1.36% ([@fig-predact-graph]). However the fit to the wetland data in the test dataset was significantly poor with a negative R^2^ = 0.03 and RMSE = 2.05%. The LMM was able to account for more variability in the uplands data with an R^2^ = 0.65 and RMSE = 1.21%. The RFM for predicting SOC % performed slightly lower compared to the LMM on the training dataset with a OOB R^2^ = 0.51 and RMSE = 1.87%. However, the RFM accounted for more variability across the entire test dataset compared to the LMM with an R^2^ = 0.64 and RMSE = 1.24% . Further, the RFM appeared to capture the variability in the wetland subset of the test dataset in stark contrast to the LMM, with a R^2^ = 0.61 and RMSE = 1.30%. The RFM also consistently accounted for variability in the upland subset of the test dataset (R^2^ = 0.64, RMSE = 1.23%). Both models appeared able to constrain high SOC % values in the test dataset which appeared to be more dispersed across wet and wetland soils [@fig-predact-graph].

Important predictors in the LMM and RFM predicting both SOC stock consistently included Depth (@fig-varimp A.). Depth was the strongest predictor in the LMM with the largest absolute coefficient value and was negatively associated with SOC stock (`r Depth_est`). The LMM for SOC stock also included an interaction between Depth and WIP [@fig-interact-plot A.], but this effect was not significant (`r depthwip_est`). Additionally the LMM identified the PET:MAP climatic variable (`r petmap_est`), Landforms, and Geolithological categories as the next most important predictors. Landforms in the LMM which had significant negative associations with SOC stock were Flat (`r flat_est`) and Spur (`r spur_est`). The Geolithological categories of Sedimentary (`r sed_est`) and Unconsolidated (`r unc_est`) both had significant negative associations with SOC stock. The Wetland Intrinsic Potential (WIP), representing the upland-to-wetland gradient was a significant positive predictor in the model with a positive association (`r wip_est`) as well as Canopy Height (`r chm_est`).

In the RFM for SOC stocks, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were highest for Depth (`r depth_shap`) then followed by several variables within close proximity to each other, indicating comparable variable importance after Depth ([@fig-varimp B.]). These included WIP with the second highest SHAP value (`r wip_shap`), PET:MAP as the third highest SHAP value (`r petmap_shap`), and MAP as the fourth highest (`r map_shap`). Predictors after MAP in terms of SHAP value included MAT, Elevation, Geolithology, and Canopy Height.

For mineral SOC %, the highest coefficient and SHAP value for both the LMM and RFM, was Depth (`r Depthlab_est` & `r depthlab_shap`), consistent with the SOC stock models ([@fig-varimp C. & D.]). Both the LMM and RFM for SOC % also indicated similar important predictors following Depth. pH showed a significant effect on SOC %, which decreased as mineral soil became more neutral indicated by the negative coefficient estimate in the LMM (`r ph_est`) and high SHAP value in the RFM (`r ph_shap`). Both models identified Clay as a significant predictor with a positive coefficient in the LMM (`r clay_est`) and high SHAP value in the RFM (`r clay_shap`). The LMM also identified a specific interaction between pH and the climate variable PET:MAP (`r petmap_ph_est`). @fig-lmm-interact B. shows the decline in SOC % as a function of pH but high PET:MAP increases the decline whereas low PET:MAP reduces the decline magnitude.

The RFM can also capture interactions between predictors which can be measured with the Friedman’s H-statistic. In the SOC stock RFM, Depth, was the largest individual predictor but showed little interaction strength (H~statistic~ ≤ 0.1) with other variables compared to other predictors. WIP was the next largest in terms of SHAP values in the RFM and showed high interaction values (H~statistic~ ≥ 0.2) with PET:MAP, Landform, and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). PET:MAP in turn had a high interaction with WIP but also with the other climate variables, MAP and MAT. In the RFM for SOC %, Depth again had lower interaction values with other predictors except for pH. Consistent with the LMM for SOC %, pH did have a large interaction PET:MAP. Clay, the third largest SHAP predictor had stronger interactions overall compared to Depth and pH but with correlated variables such as Silt+Clay and Sand. The interaction between Clay and MAP and PET:MAP was also strong.

We also investigated the large interaction terms in the RFM for both SOC stocks and SOC % using accumulated local effects (ALE) plots for WIP and pH, respectively. Each of these two predictors was plotted against the next two highest interactions shown in @fig-interact-plot in a two way interaction plot (Supplementary Figure X). The interaction between WIP and PET:MAP in the ALE plot showed marginal patterns of variation with high ALE when WIP was high and PET:MAP was small or when PET:MAP was moderate and WIP was moderate. WIP and Landform did show more variation on either end of the WIP gradient where landforms appeared to differentiate between each other. For SOC % pH and PET:MAP showed high ALE zones when pH was low and PET:MAP was low (Supplementary Figure X).

Further investigation into the top predictors from the models for both SOC stocks and SOC % was conducted using partial correlations, controlling for the effects of other important predictors while examining a single predictor. We also sought to examine the potential differences between wetlands and uplands using the WIP threshold of 50%, above which wetlands are defined. Partial correlation strength for SOC stocks differed between wetlands and uplands for Depth, MAT, and WIP, while partial correlation strength for SOC % differed between PET:MAP, pH, and Clay [@tbl-ppcor]. Wetland SOC stocks compared to upland SOC stocks had larger a negative correlation with MAT, a smaller negative correlation with Depth, and a smaller positive correlation with WIP. Wetland SOC % compared to upland SOC% had a much smaller and almost 0 correlation with PET:MAP, a larger negative correlation with pH, and a larger positive correlation with Clay.

### Upscaling SOC stock estimates across watershed study areas

We chose to use the RFM for SOC stocks based on its fit to the test dataset to upscale the observations of SOC stocks to estimate 1m SOC stocks across the full extent of the four study watersheds (HLEF, HRW, MRW, and CVW) ([@fig-ensemble-map-compare]). We calculated that the HRW had the largest SOC stock of 8.68Tg due to its large areal extent compared to other watersheds ([@tbl-socmap2]). The highest mean SOC stocks predicted by the RFM model were in the HLEF with a mean of 178 Mg ha^-1^. We estimated the lowest total SOC stocks in the HLEF, which coincides with a small relative area compared to other watersheds. The lowest mean SOC stock was estimated in the CVW. Wetlands delineated by using the WIP probability threshold of greater than 50% showed consistently higher upscaled SOC stocks compared to the overall mean and non-wetland upland SOC stocks.

{{< pagebreak >}}

Other estimates of 1m SOC stock from previously published research showed variability in the estimates for each study watershed ([@tbl-socmap2]). The ensemble combination of global models from Jones and D'Amore, 2024 had slightly higher but comparable estimates for total 1m SOC stocks in the HLEF, MRW, and CVW with higher mean SOC stocks and larger areas. However, we estimated substantially less total SOC in the HRW at 8.68TgC compared to 14.30TgC in Jones in D'Amore, 2024 [@fig-ensemble-map-compare]. Estimates of total 1m SOC stock for the North Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest from McNicol et al., 2019 were limited to the HLEF but we saw similar estimates to our study for total SOC stock and mean SOC stock. For wetland area our estimates of mean SOC stocks were slightly higher than Jones and D'Amore, 2024 for the HLEF and Jones and D'Amore, 2024 for the HRW after using a resampled WIP probability map as a map for wetland area for other published SOC maps. However, we measured lower wetland mean SOC stock in the MRW and CVW compared to [@jonesEnsembleModelInput2024]. Both estimates from this study and Jones and D'Amore, 2024 for mean wetland SOC stock were higher than upscaled mean and total wetland SOC estimates from the National Wetland Condition Assessment and the National Land Cover Database (NWCA) published by @uhranImprovedWetlandSoil2021. Our estimated mean and total upland SOC stock was in line with McNicol et al., 2019 for the HLEF. However, estimated mean and total upland SOC stock from Jones and D'Amore, 2024 were much higher than our estimates. There is a notable difference for mean and total upland SOC stock for the HRW between our estimates and Jones and D'Amore, 2024.

## Discussion

Limiting ecosystem loss and carbon emissions has driven the need for more accurate mapping of landscapes with the identification of key ecosystems and estimates of current carbon stocks [@griscom2017; @bossioRoleSoilCarbon2020]. Our analysis showed we are able to move towards a more comprehensive understanding of SOC spatial representation and its drivers through a data-driven inclusion of wetland SOC and predictor variables that incorporate wetland presence and potential formation. We found that the best models we derived for predicting SOC stocks included a continuous wetland probability metric (WIP) as a significant predictor, supporting part of first hypothesis. However, we found that models of mineral SOC % generated robust predictions without the WIP predictor, indicating the importance of edaphic factors. We found support for part of our second hypothesis by identifying that the drivers of SOC stock included Depth, WIP, and PET:MAP with the LMM including categories of Geolithology. The drivers of mineral soil SOC % were largely Depth, pH, and Clay. Finally, upscaling the RFM to all four of our study watersheds showed that we similar magnitudes of total SOC compared to an ensemble of regional and global models of SOC stock estimates. However, we were able to distinguish the high SOC stocks in wetlands for our study areas compared to uplands. We also identified more wetland extent than other wetland SOC maps which resulted in wetlands containing a higher proportion of the total landscape SOC stock. With these findings, we strongly recommend that future work towards estimating and mapping SOC incorporates estimates of wetland extent and SOC.

### Model choice influences interpretation of drivers and potential upscaling performance

Our choice to use both a LMM and RFM were driven by specifically testing hypothetical model predictors in the LMM while gaining additional insight into potential non-linear predictor relationships using machine learning with RFM. While the LMM, did not perform as well as the RFM on the test datasets, we found the LMM more interpretable regarding potential drivers. This is a well documented issue for machine learning algorithms and it is a challenge to transfer the observations derived from machine learning to process based models or ecosystem processes [@xiaResearchChallengesOpportunities2020]. However, the RFM does not require strict assumptions for the response variable distribution which is the case in the LMM and why we used a $log_{10}$ transformation for both SOC stock and SOC %. Overall we found the RFM consistently out-performed the LMM for both SOC stocks and SOC %. In particular, the RFM was able to maintain higher R^2^ and low RMSE for both wetland and upland observations in the test dataset. The difference between the LMM and RFM in capturing the SOC % in wetlands test dataset could be the result from the model flexibility of the RFM. The importance of model choice has been emphasized before in Yu et al., (2021) where a random forest outperformed a LMM in estimating SOC concentration in relation to climatic and geochemical predictors, consistent with our research results. Our research shows conservative estimates of SOC stocks are produced when LMMs are used to capture the geographic distribution of depth-dependent SOC stocks. Conversely, the complex relationships between SOC, Depth, and other factors can be captured by models such as the RFM, but with the risk of overfitting to observations and over-predicting SOC stocks in mapped predictions.

### Accurate spatial distribution of SOC stocks can be modeled across wetlands and uplands with data-driven representation of wetland presence

Inland freshwater wetlands contain large SOC stocks in both organic and mineral soils [@davidsonUnrecognizedImportanceCarbon2022]. The accumulation of SOC in wetlands is influenced by landscape hydrology and broad scale climate patterns [@chizenDriversSoilCarbon2025]. By capturing the landscape hydrologic patterns using the Wetland Intrinsic Potential (WIP), the Random Forest Model in our study captured the spatial distribution of SOC stocks in both wetlands and uplands. This data-driven landscape approach falls under a recent perspective that has been promoted as a means to better understand SOC dynamics and distribution across scales [@doetterlLandscapescaleViewSoil2025]. Concurrent with this perspective, we found the landscape distribution of SOC stocks with wetland representation in our study appeared to capture more nuance than the ensemble mean of regional and global scale models for the region. The ensemble model highlighted large SOC stocks in the study watersheds such as the HLEF and HRW, but without clear patterns regarding the landscape morphology [@jonesEnsembleModelInput2024].

However, there a few limitations for our modeling approach. One, the WIP model does not distinguish different classes of wetlands, instead it has captured the pattern and probability of saturated soils related to wetlands in the training data [@halabisky2023]. We instead relied on indices of landform, geolithology, and vegetation in order to model the different SOC stocks between potential wetland types. However, this approach could be improved by explicitly modeling the different wetland classes. Different wetland classes have been shown to have different levels of SOC stocks [@davidsonUnrecognizedImportanceCarbon2022] and capturing these differences can improve wetland SOC accounting [@stewartSettingReferenceWetland2023]. Additionally, the WIP does not specifiy the underlying hydrologic mechanism for the wetland presence on the landscape. The patterns of wetlands in these landscapes are nonetheless the first step towards improved wetland maps which are in critical need [@jacksonEcologySoilCarbon2017; @campbellReviewCarbonMonitoring2022; @novickWeNeedSolid2024]. But process-based models could be used to further improve the understanding of landscape hydrologic drivers of SOC stock [@piersonOptimizingProcessbasedModels2022].

### Drivers of SOC stocks across scales and between wetlands and uplands

Overall, our study's SOC stocks were driven by Depth across both the regional climate and landscape hydrologic gradient. SOC stocks typically decline with depth [@jobbagyVerticalDistributionSoil2000] and soil depth has been the largest predictor of SOC stocks for large scale mapping studies [@sotheLargeSoilCarbon2022]. However, SOC stocks at lower depths can vary substantially between wetlands and uplands, with large SOC stocks in organic wetland soils [@jacksonEcologySoilCarbon2017]. Wetland soils can often be multiple meters deep and contain high organic matter content [@hugeliusLargeStocksPeatland2020; @sotheLargeSoilCarbon2022]. We noted that our LMM included an interaction term between WIP and Depth, although the 95% confidence interval indicated it was not significant. We further observed a similar pattern in our dataset collection where depths below 100cm contained larger SOC stocks in wetlands defined by WIP ≥ 50%. However, the RFM had low H-statistic values for the interaction in the model. The SOC stock-depth relationship can also be modulated by other including climate which has shown strong interactions with depth to drive patterns of SOC stock [@yuClimaticGeochemicalControls2021; @vonfrommContinentalscaleControlsSoil2021]. Yet, there was not much support for this interaction within our models. The lack of interaction between Depth and climate variables in our analysis could suggest that deeper SOC stocks are somewhat isolated from climatic factors. This would be consistent with the larger proportion of deep SOC being associated with minerals which can offer physical and chemical stabilization [@hickspriesDeepSoilOrganic2023]. Interestingly, Hicks-Pries et al., 2023 found that Q~10~, a measure of temperature sensitivity, increased with depth in forest soils but not in wetland soils, although they noted a paucity of data for wetlands with this laboratory analysis.

After Depth, many of the drivers of SOC stock included large scale climatic variables, primarily PET:MAP and MAT. However, WIP was the second strongest predictor according the the RFM SHAP value. This contrasted slightly with the LMM, although some of the variability with WIP was accounted for by the interaction with Depth term. A mix of landscape-scale and continental-scale predictors have often been used to explain the spatial distribution of SOC stocks in digital soil mapping [@lamichhaneDigitalSoilMapping2019]. Particularly, our results are consistent with previous research showing the combination of a soil moisture indicator predictor, i.e. WIP, and climatic factors can explain variability in SOC dynamics [@lawrenceTrajectorySoilDevelopment2021]. By themselves, climate variables such as MAT, MAP, and PET:MAP are commonly included as the largest predictors for SOC stock distribution at larger continental and global scales [@vonfrommControlsRelationshipsSoil2024; @grayFactorsControllingSoil2015; @mishraAlaskanSoilCarbon2012]. In the Pacific Northwest region, climate variables related to water supply such as MAP and PET:MAP are stronger predictors for SOC stock compared to temperature variables [@mcnicolLargeClimatesensitiveSoil2019]. This was consistent with our finding that PET:MAP was a strong SOC stock predictor over MAT. Other predictors likely assisted model performance related to specific landscape patterns and processes. For instance, the Unconsolidated Geolithological category and the Flat Landform indicated river floodplains with recent scouring, a geomorphological process that is present in the HRW [@riedelGeomorphologyCoastalOlympic2021].

Between wetlands and uplands, defined by the 50% WIP threshold, wetland SOC stocks were more sensitive to MAT and less sensitive to Depth compared upland SOC stocks. The larger negative correlation between wetland SOC stocks and MAT is consistent with research showing wetland soils export more dissolved organic carbon as temperature increases [@fellmanVulnerabilityWetlandSoil2017]. This is also consistent with research showing that particulate organic matter is more sensitive to temperature at a global scale, and wetland SOC is often stored in organic soil horizons [@georgiouEmergentTemperatureSensitivity2024].

#### Drivers of mineral soil SOC concentration (%) are consistent in both wetlands and uplands and across climate regions

Interestingly, both models were able to capture majority of the variability for mineral SOC % across both wetlands and uplands without WIP. This is likely due to the 10% carbon content cutoff in order to examine the mineral soil specifically which removed the organic horizons sampled in wetlands. When wetlands were included in other SOC research, @vitharanaFactorsControllingSpatial2024 found wetland presence and a wetness index were the leading predictors in a random forest model for SOC % but their samples included SOC % ranging from 1.2% to 54.5%. In lower SOC % wetlands such as the Prairie Potholes, landscape position can substantially affect SOC concentration with lower concentration in the surrounding uplands compared to the inner and transition zones of wetlands [@tangenSoilOrganicCarbon2020]. In contrast to our study which did not include WIP or landform, @tangenSoilOrganicCarbon2020 found a clear decreasing SOC % trend as landscape position moved from wetlands to uplands.

The main drivers of SOC % were primarily Depth, PET:MAP, pH, and Clay. Although we saw a consistently large effect of Depth for mineral SOC % across our dataset, the coefficient and SHAP value did not substantially dwarf pH, the next largest significant predictor. This is consistent with previous research across continental scales, where pH and Depth accounted for large proportions of the variability in mineral SOC % [@yuClimaticGeochemicalControls2021]. Clay % was the next largest predictor in terms of coefficient and SHAP value which is also consistent with a long history of research showing that higher Clay % is associated with higher SOC % [@jobbagyVerticalDistributionSoil2000]. We also found that climate predictors, namely MAP and PET:MAP were included as the top predictors. However, the LMM, was more conservative and only included PET:MAP as an interaction term with pH. Interactions between climate and soil factors, particularly geochemistry have been well studied in recent years, with strong evidence that both groups play significant roles in SOC % [@doetterlSoilCarbonStorage2015; @yuClimaticGeochemicalControls2021]. In our study, partial correlation between wetlands and uplands, showed that wetland SOC % was more sensitive to pH and Clay % compared to upland SOC %. This is consistent with research from @nieStorageControllingFactors2023 showing that pH played a major role in SOC stocks and influenced effects from vegetation and climate. However, this contrasted slightly with research investigating organo-mineral associations within wetlands, @kottkampPhysicalProtectionAggregates2022 found bulk SOC % was not related to Clay % but instead found that macroaggregates promoted more SOC storage. In wetlands, more detailed analysis from other research has indicated a diverse array of factors that drive SOC %. @dongFactorsControllingSoil2022 found that Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) and Bulk Density were the largest predictors of SOC %. However, both CEC and Bulk Density measurements are often functions of SOC % and it is misleading to interpret that it is driving SOC % [@rossCationExchangeForest2008]. For this reason, we also did not consider Bulk Density in our study as a driver for SOC % and focused on the particle size and pH, although it is often useful to use BD as proxy for SOC %.

There are probably many edaphic predictors not included in this research that affect SOC % and even further SOC persistence. It is well known that poorly crystalline Fe-oxides can bind soil organic matter and protect it from microbial decomposition in moist soils [@rasmussenClayImprovedSet2018]. But this relationship is dependent on the redox environment and many other factors [@neubauerBiogeochemistryWetlandCarbon2021]. Redox cycling environments can have Fe co-precipitating and removing SOC [@bhattacharyyaRedoxFluctuationsControl2018] or high amounts of Fe could still act as a SOC preservation mechanism. There is still a need to investigate mineral SOC % and its drivers in wetlands specifically and freshwater mineral soil wetlands could represent an opportunity for carbon sequestration strategies [@creedCanRestorationFreshwater2022].

#### Regional models of SOC stock distribution can be enhanced with explicit wetland presence

Large regional to continental scale models of SOC stock spatial distribution often rely heavily on climatic variables to explain broad scale variability, then are supplemented with vegetation, terrain, and parent material metrics to account for smaller scale variability [@sotheLargeScaleMapping2022; @mcnicolLargeClimatesensitiveSoil2019; @waldenMultiscaleMappingAustralias2023; @lamichhaneDigitalSoilMapping2019]. Frequently, terrain metrics in SOC stock mapping consist of simple Slope/Gradient and Elevation metrics or compound metrics like topographic wetness index (TWI) to account for hydrologic patterns across a landscape [@minasnyChapterOneDigital2013; @lamichhaneDigitalSoilMapping2019]. Vegetation metrics often include vegetation cover classes or remote sensing indices like NDVI to capture patterns of primary productivity and biological activity [@lamichhaneDigitalSoilMapping2019]. Surficial geology or lithological maps can be used to represent soil parent material [@maPedologyDigitalSoil2019]. Our approach to mapping SOC stocks across the four study watersheds and across both wetlands and uplands integrated these factors but with an augmented terrain and vegetation approach using the wetland intrinsic potential (WIP). The WIP is a machine learning derived meric that mainly integrates multiscale terrain metrics and vegetation indices to capture more variability in the landscape hydrology corresponding to wetland formation and presence [@halabisky2023]. The resulting WIP pattern has been shown to correspond to SOC stocks in the HRW [@stewartRevealingHiddenCarbon2024] and in our current approach, was a critical predictor of SOC stocks across the other three watershed study areas. This not only supported our second hypothesis that WIP would be an important predictor, but also indicates that simple terrain metrics in large scale models could be enhanced with a more complex predictor related to landscape hydrology and soil functions.

We further argue that the WIP inclusion enhanced our modeling efforts by examining the difference with the Ensemble Model. Here, the Ensemble model predicted similar Mean and Total 1m SOC stocks across the total landscape and wetlands for the HLEF, MRW, and CVW. However, the Ensemble Model Mean and Total 1m SOC stock for uplands was within the similar magnitude for uplands in contrast to the much lower Mean SOC stock in uplands measured by our study. A potential reason for this may be derived from the the mapping of the Ensemble Model at a 60m resolution and therefore it follows that patterns of SOC are more broadly mapped compared to the RFM mapped at a 4-5m scale [@jonesEnsembleModelInput2024]. However, the mapped Ensemble Model SOC stock patterns in the HLEF and MRW seemingly capture the finer scale variation related to landscape processes or land cover mapping. The stark contrast between the maps of the HRW from our study and the Ensemble Model may point towards the over-reliance on broad climatic factors because the Ensemble Model, innaccurately maps high SOC stocks in the steep mountains of the watershed. However, the overall lack of differentiation between Mean SOC stocks for both wetlands and uplands homogenizes the landscape SOC stock distribution which can influence the perceived management needed across these areas [@doetterlLandscapescaleViewSoil2025].

The inclusion of wetlands into these landscape models of SOC stock distribution may highlight biodiversity connections to SOC dynamics [@langeIncreasedSoilCarbon2023]. Both @uhranImprovedWetlandSoil2021 and @nahlikCarbonStorageUS2016 produced the first spatially-explicit estimates of wetland SOC stocks across the continental United States, which greatly improved the understanding of the magnitude of wetland SOC storage. There is a significant need to utilize the currently available data from sources like the National Wetland Condition Assessment [@langStatusTrendsWetlands2024] and National Wetland Inventory to improve mapping of wetlands and improving potential wetland management. Management of wetland areas is fundamentally different from upland areas and it can facilitate the preservation of large SOC stocks but also a diverse array of additional co-benefits such as water quality and flooding protection [@xuWetlandEcosystemServices2020]. Our results suggest expanded wetland mapping continuously across broader regional extents should continue to reveal more unmapped wetland area and increase estimated wetland SOC stock. Forested wetlands are frequently cited for needed mapping improvements [@langStatusTrendsWetlands2024; @dahlStatusTrendsWetlands2011; @poulterReviewGlobalWetland2021] and our research shows further support for using remote sensing and data-driven approaches to address this need.

## Conclusions

The modeling efforts for the spatial distribution of SOC has overlooked wetlands within landscapes. This hinders the understanding of landscape soil carbon cycling since wetlands have fundamentally different ecosystem functions compared to uplands. To address this deficiency, we use a wetland identification tool to map the spatial patterns of wetland formation and presence as a wetland intrinsic potential (WIP) probability across a landscape. We hypothesized this WIP probability would be a significant predictor for SOC stocks and mineral soil SOC % in four study watersheds across a climatic gradient. Our results supported that WIP was a significant predictor with Depth and climatic variables for SOC stocks. But edaphic factors of Depth, pH, and Clay % were the main predictors for mineral soil SOC %. Mapping the SOC stocks using the best model, a quantile random forest (RFM), showed that we were able to highlight large SOC stocks in wetlands across all study watersheds. The mapped RFM showed more spatial heterogeneity than an Ensemble Model corresponding to wetlands and larger wetland SOC stocks than currently mapped estimates. This work emphasizes the need for improved wetland representation in both wetland maps and models of SOC stock distribution. Models for SOC stock distribution should consider how to better represent landscape soil hydrology patterns which correspond with soil carbon cycling. This would greatly improve the nuance for potential land and soil carbon management.
