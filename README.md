Code for analysis, figures, tables, writing of the manuscript: Patterns and drivers of newly revealed wetland and wet soil carbon stocks

This manuscript is under development and all results are preliminary

The majority of the R code is contained in Quarto (.qmd) files which is similar to R markdown and can be run in RStudio

R workflow for reproducing:

- The first steps are to take raw data and process to create splined observations. Then extract geospatial data for modeling 

1) PNW_SOC_spline_processing.qmd
2) PNW_geospatial_processing.qmd
3) PNW_Training_Testing_Data_Split_Scale.qmd

- Once the complete dataframes are created, modeling can be done through the following but in no particular order:
	- PNW_SOC_Linear_Modeling_Analysis.qmd
	- PNW_SOC_RF_Modeling.qmd
	- PNW_SOC_Edaphic_Linear_Modeling_Analysis.qmd
	- PNW_SOC_Edaphic_RF_Modeling.qmd
	- PNW_SOC_Linear_Modeling_Analysis_noWIP.qmd
	- PNW_SOC_RF_Modeling_noWIP.qmd	

	- .qmd scripts with "Edaphic" in the name refer to modeling SOC % with additional predictors including soil pH and texture. Otherwise the scripts model stocks 

 	- Additional .qmd documents with "noWIP" are similar modeling scripts but without the WIP parameter
- Finally mapped are produced with 
	- PNW_SOC_Prediction.qmd 
	
	- Final maps are made in QGIS
